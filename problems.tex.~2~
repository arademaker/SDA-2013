In this section we summarize the main problems identified in CPDOC's
current infrastructure and daily working environment.

As described in Section~\ref{sec:cpdoc}, CPDOC's archives are
maintained in three different information systems based on traditional
relational data models. This infrastructure is hard to maintain,
improve and refine. The information systems do not provide an
intuitive and effective interfaces to their users, making the access
to information difficult and limited.

CPDOC collections visibility online are limited. CPDOC data is
actually hide in what is called ``Deep
Web''~\cite{bergman2001white}. The information cannot be found or
access by standard search engines for mainly two reasons: (1) the page
does not exist until being created dynamically as a result of an
specific query; (2) the users are required to login in order to make
queries or access the digital files. Service providers does not access
directly the data and therefore cannot provide specialized services
using it. Users themselves do not have complete control over queries
to the collections, being limited to the interfaces offered by CPDOC.

Concerning terminology, CPDOC collections do not follow any standard
meta model, which hinders considerably the interoperability of their
data with other digital collections and websites.

Queries to CPDOC collections in general face idiosyncratic indexing
problems and low rates of recall and precision. These problems are
basically linked to the \emph{ad hoc} indexing strategy adopted
earlier to define database tables and fields.

The maintenance of 3 different information systems is expensive, time
demanding and ineffective. Improvements are hard to implement and
therefore innovative initiatives are usually postponed. We believe
this is a side effect of the adoption of a relational data model and
the traditional information systems maintenance methodology.
% Regarding the items above, it is perhaps worth justifying in
% technical detail the last one.
In a relational database system, it is well known that it is expensive
and hard to frenquently change the data model. This is due to the
assumption that a relational data model must be defined \emph{a
  priori}, i.e., before the beginning of data acquisition. Moreover,
information systems for maintenance of relational databases are also
difficult to evolve. Changes in the database require adaptations in
the system interfaces and reports. This workflow is expensive, time
consuming and demands several different professionals with different
skills: interface developers, database administrators etc.

The CPDOC researchers rely on the FGV's technical staff team from the
IT departament for any database modification and user interface
improvement. Even the addition of a new field in a table of the
database requires a whole workflow comprising: (1) the specification
of the requirement; (2) the costs and time estimation from the
technical staff; (3) the expensive authorization; (4) the allocation
of a technical profissional or team for a period of time considering
the other FGV's priorities and demands. This workflow usually takes
weeks and even months for simples changes or improvements.

Whenever distributed and interoperable data maintenance is required,
the relational data model fails severely. First, it is not easy to
keep the model and data independent. Second, data exchange is hindered
by then different storage strategies for datatypes and encodes of
strings. Third, relational data models are commonly flooded with
several auxiliary tables necessary to store non-trivial relations like
N-N relations or generalizations. And finally, in general, few model
constrains are maintained in databases, and the ones created are also
not easily interoperable.

% Concerning data storage, it is also worth mentioning that Acessus
% and Oral Historic Interviews collections are not stored in a single
% place. The actual files (digitalized documents) of personal archives
% and the files of digitalized interviews are scattered in different
% file servers.

Concerning data storage, it is also worth mentioning that the
digitalized Acessus's documents and the Oral History's interviews are
not stored in a single place, but scattered in two different file
servers. The CPDOC database only stores the metadata and paths in the
file servers, which hinders the maintenance of consistency between
files, metadata information and access control policies.

Whereas people make great use of standard search engines to query and
share knowledge, it becomes certainly one of the greatest challenges
faced by CPDOC when it comes to open their collections.
