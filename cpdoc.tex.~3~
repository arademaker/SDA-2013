% CPDOC is a major center for teaching and research in the social
% sciences and contemporary history and is located in Rio de
% Janeiro. CPDOC is also a leading historical research institute in the
% country and it holds a major collection of personal archives, oral
% histories and audiovisual sources pertaining to Brazilian contemporary
% history.  CPDOC's private historical archival program hosts more than
% 1,8 million documents ranging from politics to economics, cultural
% history to social movements, and public policy to foreign
% relations. Over the years \mbox{CPDOC} has gathered a massive
% collection of oral histories. The historical archival program is
% mainly composed of three major information systems:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Personal Archives: About 200 archival collections, comprising
%   approximately 1,8 million documents, including text, images and
%   videos.
% \item Oral History Program: A large set of testimonies (in audio and
%   video) consisting of more than 1.000 interviews, which corresponds
%   to roughly five thousand hours of recordings.
% \item Brazilian Historical Biographic Dictionary (DHBB): in the
%   current version, it consists of 7.553 entries, of which 6.584 are of
%   a biographical nature and 969 related to institutions, events and
%   concepts of interest for Brazilian history after 1930.
% \end{itemize}

% That is, the CPDOC data collection is storage in three distinct
% information systems developed originally for query and maintainance of
% three different databases. Each of these systems has independent
% management and adopts idiosyncratic criteria for the organization and
% indexing of your information. The data model vary according to the
% specific content of that they hold.

Figure~\ref{fig:cpdoc-today} presents the CPDOC current
architecture. CPDOC archives are organized in three different
information systems (the users interface of all of them are web-based)
that share a common relational database. CPDOC's web portal provides a
unify query interface for the archives metadata and low resolution of
digital files. Each of the systems has independent management and
adopts idiosyncratic criteria concerning the organization and indexing
of the information, which vary depending on the specifications of the
content they host: personal archives documents, oral history
interviews and the Brazilian Historical- Biographic Dictionary
entries. In the following subsections we briefly describe the systems.

\subsection{Personal Archives (Acessus)}

Historical documents, in textual or audiovisual supports, are precious
sources of knowledge that help us to know deeper our history. May be
in the form of handwritten and printed texts, diaries, letters,
photographs, speeches or memos and whenever they compose personal
files from people who influenced the political and social scenario of
our country, they represent much more than private memories: they are
the registry of a whole collective memory.

Currently, more than 200 personal archives that belonged to
presidents, ministers, military personal and other Brazil's important
public figures compose the CPDOC collections.  Together, they comprise
nearly 1.8 million documents or 5.2 millions pages. From this, nearly
700 thousands pages are digitalized and the expectance is to
digitalize the whole collection in the next years. The collection
entries metadata is stored in an information system called Acessus
that provides and web interface in the FGV's intranet for data query,
insert, delete and update. The web interface also provides simple
reports generation interfaces. The reports and queries are restricted
to keywords searches linked to specific database fields defined in an
\emph{ad hoc} manner. The files of the already digitalized documents
are storaged in two separated file
servers~\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server}.}. One
of them is a storage system with disk redundancy that stores the high
resolution version of the files for long-term preservation. The second
file server stores low resolution versions of the digitial files that
were used by the web systems and CPDOC's portal
(Figure~\ref{fig:cpdoc-today}).

\subsection{Oral History Interviews (PHO)}

The CPDOC collection of Oral History hosts currently more than 6.000
hours of recording, corresponding to nearly 2.000 interviews.  More
than 90\%, video or audio, are in digital format.  For the time being,
two kinds of query are available in the database: query by subject and
query by interviewed. Each interview record holds a brief technical
information and a summary with the descriptions of the interview
themes in the order they appear during the record. Only 10\% of the
interviews are transcribed, and to access the audio/video content the
user is requested to come personally to CPDOC. Currently CPDOC is
analyzing better ways of making this data available online,
considering different aspects such as the best format, use policies,
access control and copyrights.

As in the case of Acessus, the database actually stores only the
metadata about the interviews. The digitalized recorded audios and
videos are stored in digital files in the file servers.


\subsection{Brazilian Historical-Biographic Dictionary (DHBB)}

The Brazilian Historical-Biographic Dictionary (DHBB) is certainly one
of the main research sources about contemporary brazilian politicians
and themes. It contains more than 7.500 entries of biographic and
thematic nature, i.e., people, institutions, organizations and events
records carefully selected using criteria that measure the relevance
of those to the political history for the given period. The entries
were written in an impartial, avoiding ideological or personal
judgments. CPDOC researchers carefully revise all entries edition for
ensure the accuracy of the information and style criteria.

Since it was launched, the DHBB has been an important source of
information for researches, supporting the drafting of numerous theses
and dissertations. For instance, Michael Conniff, Director of Global
Studies Program and Professor of History at San Jose State University
(California, EUA), after conducting an interesting prosopographical
study over a selection of biographies extracted from DHBB, could draw
a profile of the politicians who occupied important positions in the
government after 1930 \cite{conniff}. Every biographic entry follow a
common structure of writing that brings all those information beside
conjunctures of Brazilian history.

The dictionary's database stores few metadata concerning each entry,
and the query is limited to keywords search within the title or text.

\subsection{CPDOC portal and public access interface}

The three systems presented above share a common relational
database. The implementation was conceived so as to facilitate the
construction of a single query interface over all CPDOC archives in
the CPDOC's web portal. In CPDOC's web portal users are required to
login in order to access data, and the query interface available in
there is the only means for reach that.
