% CPDOC is a major center for teaching and research in the social
% sciences and contemporary history and is located in Rio de
% Janeiro. CPDOC is also a leading historical research institute in the
% country and it holds a major collection of personal archives, oral
% histories and audiovisual sources pertaining to Brazilian contemporary
% history.  CPDOC's private historical archival program hosts more than
% 1,8 million documents ranging from politics to economics, cultural
% history to social movements, and public policy to foreign
% relations. Over the years \mbox{CPDOC} has gathered a massive
% collection of oral histories. The historical archival program is
% mainly composed of three major information systems:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Personal Archives: About 200 archival collections, comprising
%   approximately 1,8 million documents, including text, images and
%   videos.
% \item Oral History Program: A large set of testimonies (in audio and
%   video) consisting of more than 1.000 interviews, which corresponds
%   to roughly five thousand hours of recordings.
% \item Brazilian Historical Biographic Dictionary (DHBB): in the
%   current version, it consists of 7.553 entries, of which 6.584 are of
%   a biographical nature and 969 related to institutions, events and
%   concepts of interest for Brazilian history after 1930.
% \end{itemize}

% That is, the CPDOC data collection is storage in three distinct
% information systems developed originally for query and maintainance of
% three different databases. Each of these systems has independent
% management and adopts idiosyncratic criteria for the organization and
% indexing of your information. The data model vary according to the
% specific content of that they hold.

Figure~\ref{fig:cpdoc-today} presents the CPDOC current
architecture. The archives are maintained in three different
information systems that share a common relational database. 
Each of the systems has independent management and
adopts idiosyncratic criteria concerning the organization and indexing
of the information, which vary depending on the specifications of the
content they host: personal archives documents, oral history
interviews and the Brazilian Historical -- Biographic Dictionary
entries. CPDOC's web portal provides a unifying query interface. In
the following subsections we briefly describe the systems.

\subsection{Personal Archives (Acessus)}

Historical documents, in textual or audiovisual supports, are precious
sources of knowledge that help us to know deeper our history. They may
be in the form of handwritten and printed texts, diaries, letters,
photographs, speeches or memos and whenever they compose personal
files from people who influenced the political and social scenario of
our country, those resources represent much more than private
memories: they are the registry of a whole collective memory.

Currently, more than 200 personal archives that belonged to
presidents, ministers, military personal and other Brazil's important
public figures compose the CPDOC's collections.  Together, they
comprise nearly 1.8 million documents or 5.2 millions pages. From
this, nearly 700 thousands pages are in digital format and the
expectance is to digitalize the all collections in the next years. The
collection entries metadata are stored in an information system called
Acessus which can be accessed through the institution's intranet for
data maintenance and by the internet for users to make their queries.

The queries are essentially syntactic, i.e.,
% The reports and queries are
restricted to keywords searches linked to specific database fields
defined in an \emph{ad hoc} manner.  For those documents that are
already digitalized, two digital file versions were generated: one in
high resolution aiming long-term preservation and another in low
resolution for web delivery. The former are stored in a storage system
with disk redundancy, where few users have authorized access. The
latter are stored in a file
server~\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server}.}

% access. The second file server stores low resolution versions of the

\subsection{Oral History Interviews (PHO)}

The CPDOC collection of Oral History hosts currently more than 6.000
hours of recording, corresponding to nearly 2.000 interviews.  More
than 90\%, video or audio, are in digital format.  For the time being,
two kinds of query are available in the database: query by subject and
query by interviewed. Each interview record holds a brief technical
information and a summary with the descriptions of the interview
themes in the order they appear during the record. Only 10\% of the
interviews are transcribed, and to access the audio/video content the
user is requested to come personally to CPDOC. Currently CPDOC is
analyzing better ways of making this data available online,
considering different aspects such as the best format, use policies,
access control and copyrights.

As in the case of Acessus, the database actually stores only the
metadata about the interviews. The digitalized recorded audios and
videos are stored in digital files in the file servers.


\subsection{Brazilian Historical-Biographic Dictionary (DHBB)}

The Brazilian Historical-Biographic Dictionary (DHBB) is certainly one
of the main research sources about contemporary brazilian politicians
and themes. It contains more than 7.500 entries of biographic and
thematic nature, i.e., people, institutions, organizations and events
records carefully selected using criteria that measure the relevance
of those to the political history for the given period. The entries
were written in an impartial, avoiding ideological or personal
judgments. CPDOC researchers carefully revise all entries edition for
ensure the accuracy of the information and style criteria.

%Since it was launched, the DHBB has been an important source of
%information for researches, supporting the drafting of numerous theses
%and dissertations. For instance, Michael Conniff, Director of Global
%Studies Program and Professor of History at San Jose State University
%(California, EUA), after conducting an interesting prosopographical
%study over a selection of biographies extracted from DHBB, could draw
%a profile of the politicians who occupied important positions in the
%government after 1930 \cite{conniff}. Every biographic entry follow a
%common structure of writing that brings all those information beside
%conjunctures of Brazilian history.

The dictionary's database stores few metadata concerning each entry,
and the query is limited to keywords search within the title or text.
