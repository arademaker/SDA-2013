\section{The proposal}

Current CPDOC information systems were designed and developed in
the 90's and faced several modifications during the last 20 years. The
changes were motivated by different reasons: from new requirements of
users to substitution of obsolete technologies (database systems or
web development languages and frameworks). A careful analysis of CPDOC systems would consider them to be outdated especially if compared with the available systems and
technologies for data storage, indexing and long-term preservation.
As discussed before, relational databases are often hard to
maintain, scale and share. Also the idea of having closed and very
controlled systems is being increasingly replaced by the concept of
open source systems. In such systems the responsibility of updating and
creating new features is not sustained by a single institution but
usually by a whole community that share knowledge and interests with
associates. In this way the system is keept up-to-date, accessible
and growing much faster due to the increased number of contributors.

In this context we suggest that CPDOC improves the way their rich
historical data is accessed, stored and shared. Our proposal
privileges open source systems and a lightweight, shared way of
dealing with data.

% It is important to mention that CPDOC has currently three different
% information systems. Althought in the first stage the pilot project
% will involve only the DHBB system, this article is about the whole
% vision of the CPDOC data migration. This system was chosen due to
% different administrative reasons, but also because it has the simplest
% data model.

Concretely, we propose the substitution of the three CPDOC systems
by the following technologies:

The Acessus and PHO systems data and files would be transformed in an
open source institutional repository software such as
Dspace~\footnote{\url{http://www.dspace.org/}} or Fedora Commons
Framework~\footnote{\url{http://www.fedora-commons.org}}. In this
article we assume the adoption of Dspace with no prejudice of theoretical modelling. The Acessus data model
comprises personal archives that contains one or more series (which can
contain also other series in a stratified hierarchy) of
digitalized documents or photographies. The PHO system data model is
basically a set of interviews grouped according to some defined criteria within the context given by funded projects. For instance, a political event could originate a project which involve
interviewing many important people taking part on the event.

%These projects are
%the motivation and origin of financial support for a series of
%interviews conducted by CPDOC team with a specific purpose. 

It is possible to consider that Acessus and PHO systems are basically responsible for
maintaining collections of documents organized in a hierarchical
structure. In this way, one can assume that either Dspace or Fedora Commons have all the Acessus and PO
functionalities. Besides, Dspace and Fedora Commons
share features desired but not present in Acessus or PO, such as: (1) standard data
model (based on Dublin Core); (2) long-term data preservation
functionalities (tracking and notifications of chances in files); (3)
fine-grained access control policies; (4) flexible user interface for
basic and advanced queries; (5) compliance with standard protocols for
repositories synchronization and interoperability (for example,
OAI-PMH~\cite{oai} protocol); and more.

When it comes to the DHBB system, it is possible to see the model as a couple of tables for storing entries of text metadata, which are actually created and edited in
text editors outside the system. The nature of its data suggests
that DHBB could be easily maintained as text files using a
lightweight markup syntax. The files would be organized in a
intuitive directory structure and kept under version control for
coordinated and distributed maintenance.

Most of the suggested technologies are of daily use to most people with technical profile, such as software developers, but not very familiar to people with non-technical profile. In this context, a big challenge of this approach is to motivate the
internal users of CPDOC systems, i.e., CPDOC archives
maintainers, to invest their time to learn new
technologies, instead of keeping their inefficient but known way of dealing with data. 

This proposal is already implemented partially. The migration from relational databases to RDF and a simple prototype for query using Solr was built and used. The result obtained encouraged us to proposed a more complete model, proposed in this paper, which would be useful for CPDOC current needs.

% FICOU MUITO FORA DE CONTEXTO
%To make CPDOC data widely used and available, we also suggest that
%CPDOC should define a annual schedule for distribution snapshots of
%its archives in RDF format. The RDF file(s) could be offer for
%download and online available for queries in a triple store with a
%SPARQL endpoint. In the next section we further describe the proposal
%architecture.
