More than improving the current structure for storing and accessing CPDOC data, we want to exploit the semantic possibilities of such rich source of knowledge. One of the ways to do that is to embed knowledge from other sources or create new links within the available data. Since much of the data is related to people with historical relevance, or historical events, some specific ontologies and vocabularies can be used in this task. 

The personal nature of the data allows us to use projects that are already well developed for describing relationships and bonds between people, such as FOAF (Friend of a Friend) - a vocabulary which uses RDF to describe relationships between people and other people or things. FOAF permits intelligent agents to make sense of the thousands of connections people have with each other, their belongings and historical positions during life. This improves accessbility and generates more knowledge from the available data.

The analysis of structured data can also automatically extract connections and, ultimately, knowledge. A good example is the use of PROV, which provides a vocabulary to interchange provenance information. This is interesting to gather information of data that can be structurally hidden in tables or tuples. For instance [EXAMPLE].

The RDF modelling enables also the merging of data content naturally. The DBpedia project, for instance, allows connections from different sources of data in order to create a big and linked knowledge database. DBpedia allows users to query relationships and properties associated with Wikipedia resources, including links to other related datasets. CPDOC can use the same strategy to link their data to already available sources and also make their own data available to a bigger audience.

In the same direction, the use of lexical databases, such as the WordNet, applied to content sources can create automatically connections that improve dramatically the usability of a data source. BabelNet, for instance, links Wikipedia to WordNet. The result is an "encyclopedic dictionary" that provides concepts and named entities lexicalized in many languages and connected with large amounts of semantic relations. 

Much of the effort proposed is related to integrating the data available to other sources of knowledge, improving both accessibility and usability of the data CPDOC holds. To do so, it is imperative to migrate the current structure to this modern one, aligned with semantic web directives.
