\section{The problems}

% Besides, CPDOC's archives are maintained in three different
% information systems based on traditional relational data
% models. This infrastructure is hard to maintain, improve and
% refine. The information systems do not provide an intuitive and
% effective interfaces to their users, making the access to
% information difficult and limited.

This kind of environment is what is called Deep
Web~\cite{bergman2001white}. The problem is that the information
cannot be found by standard search tools, i.e., the page does not
exist until being created dynamically as a result of an specific
query.

Whereas people make great use of standard search engines to query and
share knowledge, it becomes certainly one of the greatest challenges
faced by CPDOC when it comes to open their collections.



In this section we summarize the main problems identified in
CPDOC's current infrastructure and daily working environment.

\begin{itemize}
\item CPDOC collections visibility online are limited to what
  is called ``Deep Web''. Service providers does not access directly the data and therefore cannot provide specialized services using it. Users themselves do not have complete control over queries to the collections, being limited to the tools offered by the web interface.

\item Concerning terminology, CPDOC collections do not follow any
  standard meta model, which hinders considerably the interoperability of their data with other digital collections
  and websites.

\item Queries to CPDOC collections in general face idiosyncratic
  indexing problems and low rates of recall and precision. These
  problems are basically linked to the ad hoc indexing strategy adopted earlier to define
  database tables and fields.

\item The maintenance of 3 different information systems is expensive, time demanding and
  ineffective. Improvements are hard to implement and therefore innovative initiatives are usually postponed. We believe this is a side effect of the adoption of a relational data model and
  the traditional information systems maintenance
  methodology currently used in CPDOC's systems.
\end{itemize}

Regarding the items above, it is perhaps worth justifying in technical detail the last one. In a relational database system, it is well known that it is expensive and hard to frenquently change the data
model. This is due to the assumption that a relational data model must be
defined \emph{a priori}, i.e., before the beginning of data
acquisition. Moreover, auxiliary information systems for maintenance of
relational databases are also difficult to evolve. Changes in the
database require adaptations in the system interfaces and
reports. This workflow is expensive, time consuming and demands several different
professionals with different skills: interface developers, database
administrators etc. 

Whenever distributed and interoperable data
maintenance is required, the relational data model fails
severely. First, it is not easy to keep the model and data
independent. Second, data exchange is hindered by then different storage strategies
for datatypes and encodes of strings. Third, relational data models are
commonly flooded with several auxiliary tables necessary to store
non-trivial relations like N-N relations or generalizations. And finally,
in general, few model constrains are maintained in databases, and the ones created are also not easily interoperable.

%Concerning data storage, it is also worth mentioning that Acessus and Oral Historic Interviews collections are not stored in a single place. The actual files (digitalized documents) of personal archives and the files of digitalized interviews are scattered in different file servers. 

Concerning data storage, it is also worth mentioning that both digitalized Acessus's documents and the Oral History's interviews are not stored in a single place, but scattered in different file servers. The CPDOC database only stores the metadata and file's servers path, which hinders the maintenance of consistency between files, metadata information and access control policies.
